    <li> WHERE SHE STARTED</li>
    <h3>Tech was always apart of my life in one way or another, even as a child I liked to take apart my toys to see
      how they glow or play music. My father who is an atm fixer has always taught my siblings and I about the different
      ways in which computer science can be used from taking apart PC's to breaking down the functions of the
      motherboard, I was interested in the mechanics behind each element of electronic firmware. Around age 13 I enrolled
      myself into CodeAcademy to learn more about the working of a webpage. Following my brief study of CodeAcademy I
      went into designing web pages for family & friends with small businesses. My new hobby unveiled my love of web design but it still
      wasn't enough, I loathed the creative limit of pre-structured web pages, I wanted to ingolf each page with creativity
      and uniqueness. Late 2020 I was introduced to the RoadToHire program via my aunt who saw my potential in coding
      that I myself was still unsure of but soon as I entered the program during gateway they gave us each the task of
      designing our own web page based on a place we like to travel to, finally I could unboundedly design a page giving
      off my creative touches, it was a wonderful experience that made my love for coding & webdesign even greater and now my
      future as a software engineer begins. </h3>
    <li> WHAT SHE'S ACHIEVED</li>
    <h3>After getting into the RoadToHire Coding Fellowship Program with such a rare opportunity I took full advantage of the
      knowledge I was gaining. Though rigorous & tiring at times, I felt that I had a point to prove to myself, that I
      could push through the challenges to better my skill and learn new techniques which was acquired rather quickly
      as we jumped into learning new languages such as HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React & MySQL. During this learning process
      we had many projects that challenged my mind to retain & formulate methods to better build webpages & apps, aswell
      as earning honorable certifications such as an Agile Project Management Certificate & a Growth-Driven Design
      Certificate. Here are just a few of the pages I was able to create in my short 6 month span in R2H.</h3>

    <li> WHAT SHE IS CAPABLE OF</li>
    <h3>As I continue to grow in this new field I take with me the mindset that every person we come across can teach us
      something, I've had the honor of networking with many great people during this training period rather they were
      students with more coding experience or Software engineers for a big company such as Red Ventures, Duke
      Energy, Ally bank & more, each of them taught me many lessons to succeed in my career all circling back to the
      importance of outreach & humility. It is easy to struggle in silence but it is a challenge to ask for help. I
      want to be the best I can be as I use the knowledge i've learned from R2H, I gravitated rather fast to React as it
      is one of the areas that I can push my creativity and use amazing features to do limitless things to a webpage
      with just the simplest techniques & tags. I look forward to accepting all challenges and blessings that come with this journey as a software engineer!.
